i wish to never feel their staring eyes glaring, expectedly
the burning sensation, knowing there are so many whom are aware of me
i don't want to be known

you may pick up the rose and smell it
but you will also know the pain of the thorns

i would rather drop off the face of this damnable earth
i would like to share the things that i alone create
but not to an audience, rather to a group
because i quite like my seclusion

i am a hermit and i will stay inside my shell
