I love the bugs in the dirt beneath my feet
I adore the sharks which feast
I think bird’s songs are nothing short of wonderful
And even a grizzly bear could put me into safety’s lull

The plants, so complicated yet simple
The water and the complicated ways it can ripple
A flying squirrel, soaring through the brush and branches
The ways in which a species advances

A spider, the originators of fine art
A snake coiled around my arm
A groundhog, burrowed deep inside the earth
These things and others is what the world is worth
