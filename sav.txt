I can only give so much strength until I break
Until I shatter under the weight 
I sit now antipathetic to the cracks which now writhe 
For my mental tithe to the void works me down to bone
Inexorable anxiety about nothing in particular 
You think yourself more than perpendicular to my trajectory
But the trigonometry that governs our paths through life says otherwise
I will keep on being me
Maybe not here though, i’d like to be elsewhere
Where my entropic probabilities doesn’t bother others
And where I can get away from the chaos here already
So i can stop giving strength to the people that don't matter to me
I’d rather leave than give in to your demands
