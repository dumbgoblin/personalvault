We know only what we see, what we hear
And clearly, to you, I am a specter.
Knowing nothing of whom you speak of
Yet you talk with such certainty;
Never even having let me truly speak.


And now, I must understand you,
Your ambition, your fear, your troubles?
I owe you nothing, for you never gave me
The chance to be discovered as I am.
You never even tried to see.


Instead, you began to conclude, prejudicially
That I am nothing but the other, the outsider
That accepting me is corruption,
Is losing a battle, where you force upon us your normalcy
Never even letting yourself truly hear.


You lie about my wants, my dreams,
To your confidants, to make them hate me
Under false conditions; false pretenses.
Am I the monster you fear, or is it all a lie?
You never even cared to know.


I am not the end of your war.


You cannot bend me to your will.


I am not your death.
I am not your dog.


My death would solve nothing; the world still wrong;
The systems you put in place falling apart at the seams;


And to treat me like such is a fool’s game.
You’re being played in a battle of hate.
To you, the past be no artifact, the present hold no future,
And I am sick of pretending that you are fit to judge the world as it is, 
Not as it was.
