im back into that infinite possibility space
of the clicking and the clacking 
and the words on the screen


i sit and i say the things i could never say in person
to a small little world who bothers to listen some days


i love this but it seems i forget that
when i think about writing 
and i dread it like death


i think i get so caught up with my own little perfectionism
i forget that i enjoy the act of creation
