Have you ever seen those pictures of the sky at night in places like NM, where no light pollution is present, where you can see the entirety of our galaxy?
        I look at those, and I see a brilliance that, 1000, 2000+ years ago, could only have reasonably been explained by some incredible, unimaginably powerful being’s greatest artwork. They didn’t know what we had been looking at was a collection of trillions of stars. 
To them, it was probably the greatest proof they could ever conjure of the existence of a deity. No philosopher of the time, nor no scientific genius could explain how that impossibly beautiful thing known as the night sky came to be.
So, when we talk about the advent of religion, I think the night sky had to have played a role, right? How can you not look at that and wonder; ‘How?’ or ‘Why?’ I think the fact that every time they looked up, they saw a sight unmatched by any art, a shining collection of stars, a smearing of blues and blacks and purples, that they assumed it had been made by some kind of ‘greatest artist’ of sorts.
